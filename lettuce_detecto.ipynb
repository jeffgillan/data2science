The Detecto library is a PyTorch-based library that simplifies the process of training object detection models. \n","\n","This notebook accomplishes the following tasks:\n","1. Connects to Data to Science platform (https://ps2.d2s.org) to access the drone imagery. The dataset is an orthomosaic of a lettuce field near Yuma, Arizona.\n","2. Downloads (from Huggingface) an object detection machine learning model that has been fine-tuned to detect lettuce. The model is based on the Faster R-CNN architecture. It was trained by PhytoOracle, a research group at the University of Arizona. It was trained on Maricopa Ag Center gantry images at very high-resolution (millimeters). It is trained to use RGB images and put bounding boxes around lettuce plants.\n","3. Outputs the detected lettuce bounding boxes as a polygon shapefile layer with the same geographic coordinate system as the input drone image.
